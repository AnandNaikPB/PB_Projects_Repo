W.P.No.39400 of 2006) was in constant touch with the Police authorities throughout the day and was monitoring the situation not only in respect of the City, but in respect of the whole State with which he was concerned.", "(xix) In the counter affidavit of the third respondent-Commissioner of Police dated 9.11.2006 in W.P.No.39471 of 2006, the third respondent specifically denied the allegations regarding bogus voting and Booth capturing.", "It was also stated therein that no complaint was forwarded by any of the Officers concerned as regards the bogus voting.", "(h) In the counter affidavit of the third respondent dated 9.11.2006 filed in W.P.No.39438 of 2006, it is stated that based on a complaint given by one Tmt.Devi, a candidate of CPI(M) against Thiru.", "Babu, MLA belonging to the fifth respondent-Political Party, a case was registered in CSR.No.236/06 in G.5 Secretariat Colony Police Station, which was subsequently registered as Crime No.778 of 2006 in the same Police Station for the offences under Sections 147, 323, 341, 352 and 294(b) IPC and the MLA was arrested and subsequently released on bail and the case is under investigation.", "(i) In the Annexure filed to the same counter affidavit, details relating to the complaints lodged with the Police by private parties as well as Presiding Officers have been mentioned.", "As per the details furnished in the Annexure, the following further facts can be noted, namely:", "(1) Complaint relating to Ward No.35 was received from A.R.O. Thiru.", "Michael Albert, which was registered in Crime No.1222 of 2006 for the offences under Sections 135-A and 136-B, C and F of the Representation of People Act read with Section 66-M of the Madras Municipal Corporation Act and the said complaint related to destroyal of Polling materials and sealed Ballot boxes by a mob.", "(3) A complaint was received from Thiru.", "(4) A complaint was received from Thiru.", "Thangabala, A.R.O. against some unknown persons alleging entry into certain Booths in Ward No.59, who were stated to have snatched the Ballot papers and Polling materials.", "(6) The same counter affidavit also mentions about certain other complaints received from the candidates alleging Booth capturing, removal of Ballot boxes, Polling materials, intimidation of voters, assault and violence.", "(j) In the counter affidavit filed by the Commissioner of Chennai Corporation/District Election Officer in W.P.Nos.39457, 39459, 39460, 39462, 39471 and 39635 of 2006, it was specifically stated that wherever complaints regarding snatching of Ballot papers were alleged in the Writ Petitions, the respective Polling Officers lodged complaints with the local Police and the Ballot papers were substituted immediately from the reserved papers.", "According to the fifth respondent-DMK party, the entire drama was a pre-planned one and stage-managed by the AIADMK in order to gain importance among the general public.", "(n) There was a newspaper report dated 14.10.2006 to the effect that the State Election Commission was not in a position to respond to various telephone calls on the date of Polling, namely on 13.10.2006, since he had a sudden health set-back (diarrhoea).", "(o) There was also a media report that one DGP (Training) by name Thiru.", "S.Ramani, that when he went to cast his vote at 9 a.m. in the Polling Booth located at Rani Meiammai School in Mylapore, he was informed by the Police in Mufti that the Polling Booth was closed due to violence and that he was also informed that he will not be able to cast his vote even in the evening, since the Polling Booth was once and for all closed.", "(p) Large amount of ballot papers were placed before the Court, some of which contained signatures of the Polling Officers and the column relating to the signature of the voter and certain other details were however found to have been not filled up in many of such Ballot papers.", "Invariably, in such Ballot papers, the mark was found in the \"Rising Sun\" symbol belonging to DMK Political Party.", "The allegation of wholesale bogus voting with the aid of the so-called henchmen of the fifth respondent-Political Party by snatching the ballot papers from the Polling Officers would prima-facie appear to fall under the definition of \"corrupt practices\".", "On a deeper scrutiny of the allegations made, it will have to be noted that unlike a candidate who lost in an Election and who would come forward with an allegation of bogus voting at the instance of a successful candidate in respect of a particular Ward, in the case on hand, the allegations are that almost in all the Booths covering 155 Wards, at the behest of hooligans, the Booths were captured, while the Police personnel posted remained mute spectators and the voting process was carried out by the said persons in an unruly manner, which in effect deprived the genuine voters of the respective Wards to refrain themselves from going near the Booths and cast their votes.", "The basic principle of the Constitution was to achieve the administration of Local Bodies to serve the public at the basic level for which Part IX (Panchayat) and Part IX-A (Municipality) consisting of Articles 243 to 243-ZG was incorporated effective from 24.4.1993 to achieve a democratic and republican institution from its grass-root level.", "It is alleged that the first respondent, the State Election Commission has been gained from the clout of the DMK party-men and in connivance with the said party members, has allowed indulgence of large scale violence resulting in booth capturing.", "According to the petitioner-AIADMK, it had more number of supporters in the Chennai city, considered to be their bastion.", "The 5th respondent-DMK party, known for its atrocities, dare-devil activities, unmindful of law and order, etc., sensing that if the elections are held properly, the 5th respondent-DMK party may not succeed and so they pre-planned, scripted, rehearsed and dramatised on 13.10.2006, right from the first minute of the poll, namely, 7.00 a.m. itself and adopted the following modus operandi in all 155 wards to rig the polls.", "> The rowdy elements were getting prepared the previous night itself with dangerous weapons like sickles, knives, broad blades, etc., and each of them went on rounds in vehicle allotted to them by the 5th respondent-DMK party and went to each booth.", "> With all such weapons, they entered the booth, attacked the polling agents of other parties mercilessly excluding the agent of the 5th respondent-DMK party and by forcible eviction, the booths were captured.", "> The rowdy elements were followed by the police, ironically not to prevent them, but to protect them while they were perpetrating the crime.", "> They stood by their side enabling the 5th respondent-DMK partymen to stack ballots, forcibly seized from the polling officers and started piling it up in the ballot boxes by affixing the seal on the 'Rising Sun' symbol and other fraternal parties i.e., allies of 5th respondent-DMK partymen, which are contesting the elections.", "It is further alleged that when the information of booth capturing was received by the headquarters of the petitioner-AIADMK party, efforts were made to contact the Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai, the Additional Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai, etc. From the few, who could be contacted, they were not in a position to respond.", "The Commissioner of Police and Additional Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai, in a parrot-like repetition went on stating that the polling was peaceful.", "While conversation was maintained with these officers, the injured candidates, the injured public and the injured AIADMK partymen were trailing one by one and in batches to the headquarters of the petitioner-AIADMK party.", "All these were happening within a few minutes of the commencement of the polling.", "In every ward, such incident took place and hundreds of people were injured.", "Information started coming from various booths and wards indicating that what was happening was not polling, but a pitch battle, wherein rowdy elements with the support of the 5th respondent-DMK partymen ransacked the polling booths and in many places the staff managing the booths were made to flee from the scene to save their lives and, thereafter, the ballot papers were seized and stacked in the ballot boxes in a leisurely manner.", "It was also submitted that of the persons, who captured the booths, finding some discomfort in operating inside the polling booths, those rowdy elements took the ballot papers and ballot boxes outside the polling booths and in the shade of a tree they started casting the votes in favour of the 5th respondent-DMK party symbol, \"Rising Sun\".", "A few courageous AIADMK men and persons of other political parties seized those ballot papers from them and brought the same to the headquarters of the AIADMK party and the same was exhibited to the Press and public, where it could be seen that the Presiding Officers have appended their signatures already and the same was utilised by the DMK men to cast the votes.", "It was further alleged that when the General Secretary of the AIADMK party insisted that she has to vote, respondents made arrangements for police protection as she was under \"Z-Plus\" security.", "Hence, the captured booths were relieved for a short interregnum enabling her to enter, wherein no person was present, and after she cast her vote and left the scene, the booths were captured again.", "This is exactly the allegation of the petitioners in these cases, who have alleged that in the matter of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Elections, the total Government machinery, including the Police, the Government Officers as also the State Election Commission interfered for the benefit of the ruling party, the 5th respondent.", "On the day i.e., 13.10.06, when polling for election of 155 Ward Commissioners of Chennai Municipal Corporation were in progress, a special mention was made on behalf of one of the petitioner, 'All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam' (hereinafter referred to as AIADMK) to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for immediate hearing of the Public Interest Litigation on the ground that the ruling partymen, i.e., personnel of the 5th respondent, 'Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam' (hereinafter referred to as DMK), are committing serious irregularities, engaged goondas, caused large scale violence and after attacking candidates, partymen and others, captured most of the polling booths in all 155 wards.", "On an urgent mention, on 13.10.06 itself, the case was taken up and respondents were served with notice and on their appearance the case was heard in detail at the stage of admission for its final disposal.", "They fled from their respective wards from which they were contesting and, thereafter, the polling agents, other than the polling agents of the 5th respondent party, were sent out and the booths were captured and votes were casted in favour of the symbol 'Rising Sun' throughout the 155 wards in the same pattern.", "In many polling booths, advocates were engaged as polling agents and for many wards, party advocates were engaged as chief agents.", "There were about 27 advocates, who were contesting as candidates of the petitioner-party and all of them have undergone the same experience of either having been beaten or threatened or thrown out or prevented or made to run away from the polling booths.", "It was submitted that the aforesaid act on the part of the rowdy elements indicated the level at which the police and rowdies were ruling the Chennai Metro and the police were not doing its duty, which is intended for them.", "It was alleged that in many polling booths, even by 12.00 noon, polling officers declared the elections over and they closed the gates and the police were informing the public that no one should enter the polling booths since all is over.", "It was in this background, it was submitted, that about forty advocates, who were present at the headquarters of petitioner-party represented to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice and by explaining the same in person and on the permission of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the writ petition was hurriedly prepared and filed.", "The case was initially adjourned to 16.10.06, but in the meantime, a large number of writ petitions (PIL) were preferred with regard to the said election held on 13.10.06 at Chennai.", "It includes writ petitions preferred by the political parties such as Bharathiya Janata Party (hereinafter referred to as BJP), Communist Party of India (Marxist) (hereinafter referred to as CPM), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (hereinafter referred to as MDMK), Desiya Dravida Murpokku Kazhagam (hereinafter referred to as DMDK), Lok Paritan, etc. In all these petitions, similar allegations have been made and almost same relief has been sought for i.e., to declare the election to all the 155 wards of Ward Commissioners of Chennai Municipal Corporation held on 13.10.06 as illegal and void.", "Further, he had transmitted the complaints received during the time of poll promptly to appropriate high level authorities for taking immediate action to ensure free and fair poll.", "Hence, the Election Commissioner has discharged his duties promptly, fairly and proportionate to the demand of the situation.", "In these circumstances, merely on the basis of unproved allegations and complaints, the conclusion cannot be reached that the State Election Commissioner has abdicated his duties and as a consequence of the same the entire election of 155 Wards including the 44 booths in which re-poll had taken place and in respect of which re-poll there are no complaints is invalid.", "For these reasons also, the writ petitions are liable to be dismissed.", "The following questions prominently emanate, from the above submissions made by the parties, for consideration before this Court, viz.,", "One 'Surinder Kaur' preferred a writ petition under Article 226 before the Punjab and Haryana High Court reported in AIR 1994 P & H 185, where she claimed that she was the Sarpanch for fifteen years of the Gram Panchayat, Village Dayalgarh, District Gurdaspur.", "On 17.1.93 she went at 12.00 noon to submit her nomination papers, but her husband was wrongfully detained by police and the 7th respondent in the case, and one Tara Singh had forcibly snatched the nomination papers and torn them off.", "Inspite of her complaint to the police, they did not pay any heed to her protest nor acted on her complaint.", "So, she complained at about 4.30 p.m. to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate present in the gypsy vehicle.", "There was an entry in the log book, but no action having been taken, since election was to take place on 18.1.93, she approached the High Court and filed a writ petition.", "The High Court granted stay at 2.00 p.m., which was communicated telegraphically at 3.00 p.m. on the same day, but the poll was concluded and closed at 4.00 p.m. inspite of stay order passed by the Court.", "Later on, the High Court dismissed the writ petition.", "On 13.10.06 about ten to twelve candidates were produced, who have been injured with bandage on their head or on other parts of the body.", "Newspaper reports of different newspapers dated 14.10.06, photographs of injury and loot of ballot papers and boxes as printed in different newspapers published on 14.10.06 or thereafter have been produced.", "There are complaints and police reports in 94 cases brought to the notice of the Court to suggest that some violence took place on the date of poll in the city of Chennai and 30 complaint petitions preferred by one or other political party before the State Election Commission were also produced by the State Election Commission.", "It was accepted on behalf of the State Election Commission that large number of complaints were received in its office apart from the thirty complaints, where grave allegations were made and where the matter was referred to the police authorities.", "Though such documents have been produced including unpolled ballot papers with or without stamp, seals, newspaper reports with photographs, etc., but no affidavit has been sworn with respect to the documents and materials nor proved in the manner as required in the law.", "Neither any candidate has been impleaded as party respondent to any of the writ petition nor any elected candidate has been impleaded as party respondent after the result was declared.", "If the Election Commission failed to exercise its power, or exercised its power in contravention of law, penal action may be taken against it but that cannot be a ground to declare the total election as ab initio void till it is shown that failure on the part of the Election Commission has resulted in gross injustice and that there was no free and fair election.", "If there is two possibility and two opinion with regard to the irregularities committed or is alleged to have been committed, it is difficult to arrive at the question of facts except on the report, if any, submitted by the Polling Officer or Presiding Officer or Returning Officer or District Returning Officer or any other authority of the person or any evidence led and proved in a proceeding, after giving opportunity to the affected party.", "When the writ petitions were filed on or immediately after 13.10.06, (i.e.) prior to counting and declaration of results of election of 155 wards of Chennai Municipal Corporation, there being a prohibition imposed under Article 243ZG, and in view of Supreme Court decisions as referred to above, this Court did not interfere with the matter under Article 226, which would otherwise amount to retarding, interrupting, protracting or stalling of the election proceeding.", "In absence of specific pleading and presentation of the petition dehors the provisions laid down under Rules, 2006, it is not feasible for this Court to determine whether the election in one or other of the booths or wards were free and fair and thereby whether election of one or other elected councillor of a ward or the 155 wards are void and invalid.", "This apart, there being a forum prescribed under Rule 118 of Rules, 2006, and in view of bar imposed under Article 243ZG of the Constitution and the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court in different cases as referred to above, it is not possible for this Court, under Article 226, to give any finding on merit as to whether election of one or other or all municipal councillors of Chennai Municipal Corporation held on 13.10.06 were free and fair and thereby they are void and invalid.", "The writ petitions are accordingly dismissed.",

first respondent after going through the records has decided to go for repoll of further 27 booths of 12 wards.", "He further requested the Court to allow the first respondent to count the votes of the rest of the 143 wards and after the repoll on 20.10.2006 the votes of rest of the 12 wards will be counted.", "He further prayed to allow the first respondent to announce the results of the elections subject to the final decision in the writ petitions.", "Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the various petitioners opposed such request and prayed to stay the counting of the votes.", "Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the following order is passed for the present:", "i) As requested, the first respondent is allowed to go ahead with repoll of such polling stations (booths) as it deems fit and proper;", "The respondents may file their respective affidavits on or before 31.10.2006 after serving copies on the counsel for the petitioners and the petitioners may file their rejoinder within four days thereof.\"", "Thereafter, the respondents were directed to file their detailed counter affidavits covering various allegations contained in the affidavits filed in support of the Writ Petitions.", "We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners in various Writ Petitions and learned counsel for the respondents in the Writ Petitions.",

were reported then and there.", "As is the practice in this Court, respective parties filed material papers in the form of typed set, which consisted of various documents, such as complaints preferred by the candidates, the Polling Officers, the transmission of such complaints by the State Election Commission to the Commissioner of Police and the compilation of such complaints received by the Commissioner of Police with details as to under what provisions of law such complaints were entertained and were being processed.", "That apart, on the side of the petitioners, several unpolled ballot papers, seals and other materials, which were stated to have been stealthily removed by one party or the other, were also placed before the Court, apart from the extensive media reports published immediately after the polling day.", "It was also admitted therein that some miscreants snatched and damaged the reserve Ballot boxes and as against them, complaints have also been lodged.",

the Polling process, re-poll was ordered, which was in the order of 44 Booths.", "(k) The Director General of Police, the second respondent in W.P.No.39400 of 2006 filed a counter affidavit in one

State, there have been a few incidents of interference with the Polling process by theft or causing damage of ballot material.\"", "(q) Except the complaint made by one Thiru.", "The question therefore that falls for consideration is whether in such a situation, could it be said that the remedy provided under Section 54-A, B and C of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act should be directed to be invoked for the redressal of the grievances.", "To have a broader spectrum of the scenario that existed on 13.10.2006, it will be appropriate to state in detail how this Court was moved at the instance of the petitioners on the date of Elections.", "On the date i.e. on 13.10.2006, when Polling for Elections of 155 Wards was in progress, a special mentioning was made on behalf of one of the petitioners (AIADMK) to the Honourable Chief Justice for immediate hearing of the Public Interest Litigation on the ground that the ruling party-men i.e. personnel of the fifth respondent-Political Party (DMK) were committing serious irregularities, engaged Goondas, caused a large scale violence and after attacking the rival candidates, their party-men and others captured most of the Polling Booths in all the 155 Wards.", "On an urgent motion on 13.10.2006 itself, the case was taken up and the respondents were served with notice and on their appearance, the case was heard in detail at the stage of admission for its final disposal.", "Further, it was alleged on behalf of the petitioner-AIADMK party that the Chennai City was highly surcharged, the voters were terrorised, the candidates of opposition political parties and independent candidates were terrorised, beaten and attacked with dangerous weapons.", "They fled from their respective wards from which they were contesting and, thereafter, the polling agents, other than the polling agents of the DMK party were sent out and the booths were captured and votes were cast in favour of the symbol \"Rising Sun\" throughout the 155 wards in the same pattern.", "In many polling booths, advocates were made as polling agents and for many wards, party advocates were made as chief agents.", "There were about 27 advocates, who were contesting as candidates of AIADMK and all of them have undergone the same experience of either having been beaten or threatened or thrown out or prevented or made to run away

explaining the same in person and on the permission of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, the said writ petition was hurriedly prepared and filed.", "It is submitted that similar was the ambience at the time of Madurai Central Assembly by-election, but because of the intervention of the Election Commission of India and the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, polling was smooth and peaceful at Madurai, whereas in the local body election, it has been conducted by the State Election Commission, which is totally in the pocket of the ruling DMK party.", "The very fact that terrorism has been let loose at every polling booth, according to the petitioner, the same is indicative that the polling process was not at all done in accordance with law.", "It was not a free and fair election.", "On 13.10.2006, in the afternoon when the case was taken up, about thousand persons gathered inside the Court premises and after much persuasion about a hundred and odd persons alone were allowed to watch the proceedings inside the Court and about ten to fifteen members of lawyers and other persons were produced before the Court with injury in support of the claim as made by the petitioner in the writ petition.", "A large number of unpolled ballot papers of about eight to ten booths with stamp on 'Rising Sun' symbol or without stamp were produced in many of which there were signatures of some officer in the back portion, but many of them were also blank.", "I am narrating the aforesaid facts, as all these documents were produced before the Court and on request were kept separately and shown to the learned Advocate General, the counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu as also the counsel for the State Election Commission.", "The case was initially adjourned to 16.10.2006, but in the

assisting the first respondent-State Election Commission to regulate the whole Election process on 13.10.2006, as stated in detail in paragraph 104 of my order, as there were as many as more than 90 specific complaints received by them either directly or through the first respondent-State Election Commission, all of them related to poll related violence.", "Even amongst them, such complaints mainly related to booth capturing and bogus voting.", "In the counter affidavit dated 15.10.2006 in paragraph 5 in W.P.No.39400 of 2006, she has made a categoric statement that out of 3295 booths, there have been no complaints registered with the police for booth capturing by any of the Polling Officers and in respect of 17 booths alone, the irregularities reported to the State Election Commissioner resulted in orders for re-poll.", "In paragraph 7 of the same counter affidavit, the Commissioner of Police would state that the media reporting was not correct and that everything was blown out of proportion.", "However, in the counter affidavit dated 9.11.2006 filed in W.P.No.39438 of 2006, the third respondent-Commissioner of Police has filed an Annexure referring to 8 of the complaints received, which were all relating to unauthorised entry of persons other than the voters causing damages to booth, ballot papers, boxes and polling materials.", "The total number of booths referred to in the said Annexure related to atleast 8 wards and in respect of one ward alone, the specific complaint was that 19 booths were captured and bogus voting was recorded.", "In the very same Annexure, in respect of the said one ward, namely Ward No.130, not even in respect of one booth, re-polling was ordered.", "S.Ramani who was stated to have gone to the polling booth located at Rani

while declaring the names of the successful candidates.", "Having regard to my above conclusions and even after filing of the Writ Petitions, where an opportunity was extended to the first respondent-State Election Commission, which displayed total indifferent attitude, I am of the view that no purpose will be served by remitting the matter back to the first respondent-State Election Commission.", "Consequently, the first respondent-Election Commission is directed to hold the Elections afresh to all the above 99 Wards by strictly adhering to the norms and by providing adequate Police protection in order to enable the voters to cast their vote freely without any interference from any quarters to enable them to cast their vote in a free and fair election.", "The Writ

produce the same.", "However, the Magistrate entertained the bail application filed by the respondents herein on the same day and granted bail, taking into consideration of the fact that already they obtained anticipatory bail in respect of the same case by Madras High Court.", "In this context, it would be worthwhile to refer to the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Medchal,

would indicate that the police themselves informed the Magistrate about the anticipatory bail granted to the accused by Madras High Court, but the accused were not able to produce any orders, regarding the intimation of the VIII Metropolitan Magistrate, George Town, Chennai, having accepted the sureties.", "This would show, even though the accused stated that they had executed bonds before

the sureties to the satisfaction of this Hon'ble Court and obey the process.\"", "As stated above, the accused did not even mention in the bail application that they had already furnished sureties to the Magistrate concerned.", "In this regard, we have to view the act of the appellants/contemners, in arresting the respondents/accused and producing them before the Magistrate concerned at Medchal, Andhra Pradesh.", "It is seen from the affidavits filed by the appellants before the learned single Judge that they had tendered unconditional apology, for the mistake committed by them.", "Even then, the learned single Judge, on the basis of the records summoned from the Court at Medchal, found them guilty and did not accept apology.", "Even assuming that the anticipatory bail order copy was shown to the police officials by the accused only at the time of arrest, the police officials should have immediately verified from the Court concerned, as to whether sureties had been furnished by the accused within 10 days from the date of the order passed by High Court of Madras.", "Admittedly, this was not done.", "But, it is to be noted, even when the accused were produced before the Judicial Magistrate, the police officials intimated to the Magistrate, through the remand requisition, that the accused obtained interim anticipatory bail order from Madras High Court, enclosing the xerox copy

{"id": "75560987", "text": ["As the learned Judge acquitted the accused, the State has filed this appeal under Section 19 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (herein after referred to as the \"TADA Act\").", "The prosecution case is that Shivarajan alias Raghu (Respondent/Accused No. 1) and Vigneswaran alias Vicky (Respondent/Accused No. 2) who were Sri Lankan nationals and members of LTTE came to India sometime in 1989 without any traveling documents.", "So also, Guna and Dixon who were Sri Lankan nationals and members of LTTE had come to India in the like manner.", "Since then they were engaged in obtaining explosive substances, manufacturing bombs and sending them to LTTE in Sri Lanka.", "In the said clandestine activity they were helped and assisted by Respondent Nos. 3 to 9 (Accused Nos. 3 to 9) who are Indian nationals.", "Till the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on 21.5.91, they could carry on the said activity without any hinderance.", "Thereafter it became difficult for them to do so as the whole of Tamil Nadu was declared as a Notified Area with effect from 23.6.91, under Section 2(1)(f) of TADA Act and also because the Government of India and the Government of Tamil Nadu tightened security measures within the State of Tamil Nadu.", "The police was also on look out for Sri Lankans who did not possess passport and visa for staying in India and had also required the house owners to report to it if such Sri Lankans were found to be occupying their houses.", "Due to such strict measures A-1, A-2 Guna and Dixon found it difficult to obtain accommodation for their residence and for manufacturing bombs and storing them and therefore, they went on changing houses after taking them on rent by making misrepresentations.", "Since February 1991 A-1 and Guna had taken on rent one house bearing Door No. 11/12 A situated in Shivaji Colony in Coimbatore.", "Dixon and others were occupying a different house in Coimbatore.", "As the LTTE was in desperate need of hand grenades and bombs and wanted them to be supplied latest by the end of first week of August 1991, A-1 to A-5 and A-7 to A-9 and Guna met at the house of A-1 in Shivaji Colony and decided to manufacture and send them to Sri Lanka and also to strike terror in the people by using bombs or other explosives and thereby causing damage to Indian property or death or injuries to Indian leaders and other persons if they came in their way.", "All the nine accused along with Guna and Dixon continued to manufacture different parts of hand grenades and plastic bombs and store them at different places. A-1 and A-2 were required to change their residence from shivaji Colony to a house in Dr. Muthuswamy Colony as the owner of the house objected to their suspicious activities.", "On 28.7.91, A-1 and A-2 after making necessary arrangements for transporting the hand grenades and plastic bombs manufactured by them with the help of other accused and which were to be filled with explosives at Trichy returned to the house in Dr. Muthuswamy Colony.", "They found police standing near their house.", "So they went to another house where some more articles were kept.", "There they came to know that Guna and Dixon had committed suicide as the police had surrounded their house.", "In the evening A-1 and A-2 were going on a Kinetic Honda scooter.", "P.W. 1 Pandurangan, a traffic police constable signaled them to stop as he noticed that the scooter was being driven very fast.", "Instead of stopping the scooter, A-1 who was driving it, attempted to dash it against him.", "P.W. 1 jumped aside and saved himself.", "After covering some distance A-1 and A-2 fell down on the road along with the scooter.", "P.W. 1 then went to that place and asked A-1 to show his licence.", "A-1 challenged him by saying as who he was to ask for a licence.", "A-1 then said \"if this police man is done away with, this police department will then understand\".", "He also threatened P.W. 1 by stating that if he tried to catch him, beat him or sent him out of the country he would destroy the entire Tamil Nadu.", "P.W. 1 suspecting them to be LTTE terrorists, shouted for help and blew his whistle.", "Thereupon A-1 attempted to start the scooter but it did not start.", "Hearing the shouts and the whistle two police constables, Sivagnanam and P.W. 2 Devasayayam came there.", "The three police constables with the help of other persons tried to take both the accused in custody.", "At that time A-1 took out a cyanide capsule from his pant pocket and attempted to put it in his mouth.", "P.W. 1 pushed his hand aside and the capsule fell down on the road.", "The police constables then took both the accused to Thoodivalur police station.", "To prove the consent the prosecution had examined P.W. 52 Balachandran who was then acting as the P.A. of the District Collector.", "He has deposed about the requisition sent by the investigating officer and the reports and other documents sent along with it and consideration of the same by the District Collector before giving his consent.", "In his cross-examination he stated that he had not noticed in the relevant file statements of witnesses.", "There P.W. 1 lodged a complaint against them under Section 353, 307 and 309 IPC.", "On the basis of this complaint Inspector Angamuthu, P.W. 55 started the investigation.", "On the basis of further information other charges under the TADA Act and Explosive Substances Act, 1908 were also added.", "During the investigation various incriminating articles like incomplete grenades or bombs or their parts and the vehicles used in transporting the same were discovered at the instance of the accused or were recovered from their possession.", "On these allegations, A-1 to A-5 and A-7 to A-9 were charged for the offences punishable under Section 120-B read with Section 3(3) of the TADA Act. A-1, A-3 to A-5 and A-7 to A-9 were also charged for the offences punishable under Sections 3(3) and 5 of the TADA Act. They were also charged for commission of the offence under Section 4 of the Explosives Substances Act. A-6 was charged under Section 5 of the TADA Act and Section 4 of the Explosives Substances Act. A-1 and A-2 were further charged under Section 307 read with Section 34 IPC A-1 was individually charged for the offences punishable under Sections 353 and 309 IPC", "In order to prove the conspiracy the prosecution relied upon the evidence of P.W. 21 Prem Kumar, P.W. 38 Kumar, confessional statements of A-2 and A-9 and also the evidence of other witnesses who deposed that between the first week of July 1991 and 3.8.1991 they had either seen some of the accused together or seen them manufacturing, storing and transporting parts of bomb and grenades.", "As the charge against the accused regarding conspiracy was specific that said conspiracy was hatched during that period, in the house bearing Door No. 11/12A of Shivaji Colony, the learned trial judge held that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the conspiracy was hatched as alleged.", "When the said house was in occupation of A-1 all the accused had met there and conspired as alleged.", "The learned trial judge having found that between 11.7.91 and 28.7.91 A-1 and Guna resided in a different house situated in Dr. Munusami Colony and that there was no evidence to show that A-1 to A-5 and A-7 to A-9 and deceased Guna were found together in any place during the period from first week of July to 3.8.91 and had agreed to do any illegal act, held that the charge of conspiracy was not proved.", "Though the prosecution had also relied upon the confessional statements of A-2 and A-9 in order to prove the charge of conspiracy the learned judge did not take them into consideration as he was of the view that they were not recorded in the manner prescribed by Section 15 of the TADA Act and Rule 15 of the TADA Rules and therefore could not be accepted in evidence.", "In the alternative he held that even if they were accepted as evidence they alone could not be made the basis for conviction of the accused.", "To prove possession of bombs, grenades and explosive substances by the accused the prosecution had relied upon the evidence of those witnesses who deposed about their having seen the accused either making purchases of raw materials for preparing hand grenades or bombs or manufacturing parts of the bombs or transporting such parts and also of those witnesses in whose presence such parts and explosive substances were recovered.", "The learned judge held that the evidence regarding recovery of the articles from various accused was not sufficient.", "Therefore, this charge was also held as not proved.", "The learned Judge, therefore, acquitted all the accused of all the charges leveled against them.", "Aggrieved by the said order of acquittal the State has filed this appeal.", "The other findings are challenged on the ground that the evidence relating thereto has not been correctly appreciated and the reasons given in support thereof are improper and untenable.", "On the other hand the learned Counsel appearing for the respondents supported the findings on the grounds given by the trial court and submitted that the acquittal of the accused is proper and just and does not call for any interference by this Court.", "We will first consider the charge of conspiracy and the evidence led to prove it.", "The prosecution case was that as, after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on 21.5.91, it became very difficult for A-1, A-2, Guna, Dixon and others who were engaged in manufacturing hand grenades and bombs for the LTTE and as the LTTE was in dire need of those bombs latest by the end of the first week of August 1991, the accused met at the house of A-1 and A-2 situated in Shivaji Colony in the first week of July 1991 and hatched a conspiracy by agreeing \"to commit illegal acts by illegal means, to strike terror in the people by using bombs and other explosive substances as was likely to cause death and injuries to Indian Leaders and people who might prevent their unlawful activities and also to manufacture grenades and explosive substances in the notified area of Coimbatore.", "Thus, the charge framed against the accused was not only that they had conspired to commit terrorist acts but they had also conspired to manufacture explosives like grenades and bombs in the notified area.", "The learned Counsel for the appellant was, therefore, right in his submission that the learned Sessions Judge did not properly appreciate what exactly was the charge against the accused and failed to consider if the charge that they had also conspired to manufacture explosives was proved.", "He also rightly submitted that the charge against the accused was that the accused had entered into a criminal conspiracy in the first week of July 1991 in House No. 11/12-A of Shivaji Colony and the illegal acts referred to in the charge were committed in pursuance of that conspiracy between first week of July 1991 and 3.8.91 and therefore, the learned Sessions Judge was not right in holding that the charge of conspiracy was not proved as there was no evidence to establish that between 3.7.91 and 3.8.91 the accused had met in the said house and conspired to commit the said illegal acts.", "As A-2 had shown his willingness again and as he was satisfied about the he had decided to record it.", "He had got it written on a typewriter.", "It was then read over to A-2 and his signatures were taken on each page as he had accepted that it was correctly taken down.", "He had also signed the statement and the certificate.", "The confessional statement (Exh. 51) of A-9 was recorded on 3.10.91 by P.W. 51 Appadurai.", "He has also given similar evidence and denied the suggestion made to him in his cross-examination that he had written down a false confession and obtained signatures of A-9 on it under a threat.", "There was a talk that bombs are required for ANAIYlRAVU WAR: Bombs have to be sent by the first week of August on any account.", "It was also admitted by A-9 in his statement under Section 313 of the Code that those articles were found from his custody though his explanation with respect to the possession of Galantine sticks and detonators was that they were given to him for safe custody under a threat by deceased Guna.", "In his confession (Exh. P-51) also he admitted that the said articles were seized by the police officers in presence of a witness from his workshop and that he had produced the same.", "Thus, the possession of the articles which are held by the learned Sessions Judge to be explosive substances as defined by the Explosive Substances Act, by A-1 and A-5 to A-9 is established by the prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt.", "Relying upon this answer given by the witness the learned Sessions Judge held that in absence of such statements the District Collector cannot be said to have applied his mind properly to the facts of the case before granting the sanction.", "From the evidence of the witness and the copy of the proceedings of the Collector it appears that the Inspector of Police had sent his report regarding the evidence collected by him together with a copy of the FIR, the reports of the Forensic Department and other connected record.", "Thus, the Mahazars under which the \"explosive substances\" recovered and seized by the police from different accused were placed before the Collector and on consideration of all that material the Collector had given his consent.", "We do not think that for obtaining consent of the Collector for prosecuting the accused for the offence punishable under the Explosive Substances Act it was necessary for the investigating officer to submit the statements of witnesses also, who had deposed about the movements of the accused and their activity of manufacturing bombs and grenades.", "We, therefore, hold that the consent given by the Collector was quite legal and valid.", "38. A-1 and A-2 were also tried for the offence punishable under Section 307 read with Section 34 IPC.", "In order to establish this charge the prosecution had examined P.W. 1 Pandurangan who had deposed about the manner in which A-1 was found driving his Kinetic scooter in a rash and negligent manner, his signalling him to stop the vehicle and A-1 trying to dash the scooter with him.", "The prosecution had also led evidence of P.W. 2 Devasayayam, P.W. 4 Arumugham, P.W. 6 V. Arumugham and P.W. 7 Singaram to corroborate the evidence of P.W. 1 Pandurangan.", "The learned Sessions Judge disbelieved the evidence of these witnesses on the ground that the version given by them was artificial and unbelievable for the reasons that (1) the accused had not sustained any injury (2) no damage was noticed on the scooter (3) the FIR did not refer to the presence of the three independent witnesses and (4) though Singaram and Radhakrishnan were cited as eye-witnesses the prosecution examined only Singaram.", "P.W. 2 Devasayayam had helped P.W. 1 Pandurangan in taking A-1 and A-2 in custody and had accompanied P.W. 1 to the police station.", "His statement was also recorded soon after the FIR was prepared.", "In the FIR the name of Singaram was mentioned as an eye-witness.", "The learned Sessions Judge has disbelieved the evidence of Singaram also on the ground that he did not depose about the presence of the other three witnesses.", "In his evidence he has stated that he was in the shop of P.W. 6 along with Radhakrishnan.", "No other reason has been given by the learned Sessions Judge for disbelieving the evidence of those witnesses.", "It is quite likely that A-1 having lost the balance after making an attempt to dash the scooter against P.W. 1 Pandurangan could not keep the scooter standing while stopping it.", "That appears to be the reason why the scooter and A-1 and A-2 fell down on the road.", "The scooter had stopped running and that is borne out by the evidence of those witnesses and that explains why neither A-1 nor A-2 had received any injury nor was there any scratch noticed on the scooter.", "Thus, none of the grounds given by the learned Sessions Judge for holding the version of the witnesses as artificial and unbelievable can be regarded as a good ground.", "The said finding is partly based upon the misreading of the evidence and partly upon the reasons which are not proper.", "We, therefore, hold that the charge against A-1 that he had tried to dash the scooter against P.W. 1 Pandurangan is established beyond reasonable doubt.", "However, in absence of any evidence or circumstances it is not possible to infer that the intention of A-1 was to attempt to murder P.W. 1 Pandurangan.", "Accordingly this appeal is partly allowed.", "Acquittal of all the accused for the offence punishable under Section 120-B IPC read with Section 3(3), TADA Act, for the offences punishable under Sections 3(3) and Section 5 of TADA Act and Section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act and that of A-1 and A-2 under Section 307 read with Section 34 IPC is confirmed."], "labels": ["Section 353 in The Indian Penal Code", "Section 313 in The Indian Penal Code", "Section 34 in The Indian Penal Code", "Section 120B in The Indian Penal Code", "Section 307 in The Indian Penal Code"]}

materials were put to the accused, they denied the same as false.", "However, they did not choose to examine any witness on their side nor mark any document.", "Their defence was a total denial.", "Having considered all the above, the trial Court convicted the accused as detailed in the first paragraph of this judgement.", "We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and also the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the State and we have also perused the records carefully.", "As we already pointed out, the first accused died during trial and thus, the charges against him stood abated.", "The prosecution has made an attempt to prove the charges against the second accused/appellant by circumstantial evidence.", "The first circumstance is that the deceased was found dead at arount 1.00 a.m. on 3.9.2011 at her house.", "Her legs and hands were tied and a cloth was inserted into her mouth.", "The doctor, who conducted autopsy, has opined that the death of

was also robbery committed in the same transaction.", "During investigation, chance finger prints were lifted from the steel bureau kept in the room, where the dead body was lying.", "Those two chance finger prints tallied with the finger prints of the first accused.", "But, this may go to prove only the guilt of the first accused and the same cannot be used against the second accused.", "So far as the second accused/appellant is concerned, the only evidence against her is that on her arrest, M.Os.1, 2, 7, 8 and 10 were recovered.", "The learned counsel for the appellant would submit that these recoveries cannot be proved.", "Assuming that these material objects were recovered from the house of the appellant, it cannot be conclusively stated that they were in the exclusive possession of the appellant.", "The first accused is, after all, her husband.", "The probability that the first accused had committed the crime and kept the material objects in the house cannot be ruled out.", "But at the same time, the fact that the appellant had knowledge that these properties were kept in her house, cannot be doubted.", "From these two facts, it can be presumed, as provided under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, that the accused is either the thief or the one who had received the stolen properties.", "In order to presume that the accused was the thief, we do not have any other material.", "But the single fact that the finger prints of the first accused were found on the bureau and that the possibility of the first accused keeping the stolen articles in the house cannot be ruled out, would go to show that the presumption of theft on the part of the appellant cannot be raised.", "At the same time, the presumption that she would have received the stolen properties from the first accused cannot be ruled out.", "Thus, in our considered view the prosecution has established that the appellant has committed an offence under Section 411 of the Indian Penal Code.", "Thus, we hold that the prosecution has failed to prove the charges under Sections 302 read with 392 and 450 IPC.", "Now turning to the quantum of punishment, the appellant is aged about 30 years and her husband has already died.", "She has got a child aged one year.", "The child is also along with her in the prison.", "She has got no bad antecedents.", "In the result, the appeal is partly allowed.", "The conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant/second accused for the offence under Sections 450, 302 and 392 IPC are set aside and instead she is convicted under Section 411 of the Indian Penal Code and the period of sentence is reduced to the period of sentence already undergone by her and she is further directed to pay a fine of Rs.200/-, in default, to undergo rigorous imprisonment
